title: SAEL Acoustic Software 
---

The Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab has focused effort on developing a streamlined approach to passive acoustic data analysis that relies an Open Science approach, including a reliance on open-source software.

PAMpal is an R package for processing passive acoustic data. Currently PAMpal only supports data collected using PAMGuard ([pamguard.org](pamguard.org)), but in the future we hope to support other platforms.

In addition, we have developed these R software packages to address other needs:

-   [PAMmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PAMmisc)- A collection of miscellaneous functions for passive acoustics (much of the content is adapted from R code written by other people).

-   [BANTER](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=banter)- A heirarchical species classifier for acoustic events developed using multiple call type detectors (see [Rankin et al. 2017](doi:10.1111/mms.12381)). Banter User's Guide available [here](https://taikisan21.github.io/PAMpal/banterGuide.html).

-   [PAMscapes](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PAMscapes)- A variety of tools relevant to the analysis of marine soundscape data (including tools for downloading AIS data from [Marine Cadastre](https://marinecadastre.gov/ais/), connecting AIS data to GPS coordinates, plotting summaries of various soundscape measurements, and downloading relevant environmental variables (wind, swell height) from the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds084.1/).

-   Driftwatch- Driftwatch was developed to help with tracking of drifting acoustic buoys using satellite GPS. The basic code is available on Github, but there are a number of steps required to get it to function for outside use. See '[Setting_Up_Driftwatch.rmd](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/DriftWatch/blob/main/Setting_Up_DriftWatch.rmd)' in [Driftwatch Github repo](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/DriftWatch) for more information.
