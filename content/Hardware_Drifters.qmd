title: Drifting Recorders
---

## Overview

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Drifting recorders consist of hydrophones deployed at depth below a drifting buoy. They are relatively low cost, which allows for deployment of multiple instruments (increasing the spatial coverage of the area). The hydrophones are positioned near the animals in the water columns (neither at the surface nor the seafloor).

Drifting recorders have been increasingly deployed during large scale shipboard surveys to augment visual line-transect surveys for cryptic and deep-diving species. As drifting recorders are neither tethered to the seafloor nor to a ship, they have shown potential as an alternative PAM platform for deep waters offshore the U.S. West Coast.

## Components

### Recorder

These drifting buoys can use two types of [Ocean Instrument SoundTrap Recoders](https://www.oceaninstruments.co.nz/); ST640 and ST4300

There are common hardware and software errors associated with these instruments. See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HYPw2-IsgiTonLoSUGJ00FHVmN4wSoPqCmpd0fQESbk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for a list of common errors.

See [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/content/Hardware-Subsurface.html#recorder) for more information of recorder types

### Hydrophone

Each drifting buoy is equipped with a two-element vertical hydrophone array below the recorder. The hydrophones are from [High Tech, Inc.](https://www.hightechincusa.com/products/hydrophones/), with the top hydrophone being an [HTI-92WB](https://www.hightechincusa.com/products/hydrophones/hti92wb.html) and 5 meters below that, a [HTI-96min](https://www.hightechincusa.com/products/hydrophones/marinemammal.html).

Each hydrophone has a specific sensitivity and when coupled with the recorder, the array will have an overall system sensitivity. Hydrophone sensitivity and recorder sensitivity/gain values can be found in our inventory [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12u6cwwbuM7BfPt2GKjMXEOwr9yeK0_ztD04aNVYoFIk/edit?gid=395300949#gid=395300949). For soundscape analysis and system calibration, overall system sensitivity values for past deployments can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bxlwfVOe1LFfj69B_YddxcA0V14m7codYwgD2YncFk/edit?gid=42687545#gid=42687545).

For new deployments, the hydrophone sensitivity can be calculated using the [`CheckSystemSensitivity.r` script here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/SAEL-lab-manual/blob/3c5a8922166c0eae19c3c9ff4e274ec7c01a2b76/Scripts/CheckSystemSensitivity.R).

## Projects

### ADRIFT

The ADRIFT in the California Current Project (2020-2024) used passive acoustic drifting recorders to collect data on marine mammals and the ocean soundscape offshore California and Oregon. This work was co-funded by NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). More information on the Adrift project can be found [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/).

Detailed information on building and using drifting acoustic recorders can be found in the [Adrift Field Methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/).
