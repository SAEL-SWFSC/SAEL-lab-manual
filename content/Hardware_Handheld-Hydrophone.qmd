### **Testing the Hydrophone with Handy Recorder**

**\*\*Take extra precaution when working with the hydrophone sensor end. Do not put excess pressure on or crush the hydrophone\*\***

1.  Remove hydrophone, preamplifier, and Handy Recorder from box

2.  Connect the hydrophone to the preamplifier by plugging the yellow labeled end of the hydrophone to the preamplifier box and twist the hydrophone cable to lock them together ![](images/hh_preamp.png)

3.  Connect the other end of the preamplifier to the Handy Recorder, align three pins from preamplifier to the channel 1 recorder port, and click into place![](images/hh_preampCh1.png)

4.  Turn on Handy Recorder using power button on the left side, and ensure the four channel (4CH) recording option is selected at the top (see help steps below in [Recording Only With One Hydrophone (Single-Channel Recording](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Hardware_Handheld-Hydrophone.html#single-channel-recording))

    ![](images/hh_4chOn.png)

5.  Press the record button once and lightly tap on each of the two attached microphones on top of the recorder, as well as the hydrophone

6.  Check for signal changes on the recorder screen

    1.  Each of the three recording bars (MIC L & R, IN 1) should be moving and the record button should be blinking red
    2.  If there is no signal change for the hydrophone, follow steps in Recorder Not Displaying Signal Change From Hydrophone section
    3.  If testing hydrophone in water, ensure only the end of the hydrophone is in the water, and no other components, including the preamplifier and recorder, get wet

    ![](images/hh_signalCheck.png)

7.  Once both microphones and the hydrophone has been tested, press the stop button and turn off the recorder

8.  Carefully remove the preamplifier/hydrophone cable from the recorder (press metal tab on back of recorder port while pulling the cable)

9.  Untwist the hydrophone, pull cable from preamplifier, and return all components to hydrophone and recorder cases

### **Setting Up and Changing Settings for Handy Recorder**

#### **Loading an SD Card**

An SD card is required to record and save on the Handy Recorder

1.  Make sure recorder power is off
2.  Insert SD card into slot on right side of the recorder

**Cautions**

-   SD card must be 16MB to 32GB
-   If "Format Card" appears on the display startup, the SD card must be formatted for the device. Press DIAL and select YES to format the SD card for the H4n Pro
-   Clear SD card before recording to ensure there is ample space

#### **Single-Channel Recording**

Recorder should be set up to record on 4 channels (two attached microphones and two channel ports on the bottom of the recorder where the hydrophone is plugged in). This is useful in the event you want to narrate what is happening at the surface while the hydrophone is recording (i.e. whales breaching at this time). Follow these steps to change to single channel recording, to only record with the hydrophone, not the attached microphones. (Follow steps and picture below)

1.  Click menu button on right side of Handy Recorder

2.  Use scroll wheel to go to Mode option and press scroll button in to select Mode

3.  Use scroll button to move to Stereo (single channel) and push scroll button in to select it 

4.  Recorder screen should return to main screen and STEREO light indicator should be on

    ![](images/hh_ScrollMenuStereoButtons.png)

5.  Press the 1 button on bottom left of recorder, and channel 1 & 2 light indicators should turn on (may be on already) 

    1.  Ensure mic button is not lit up 

6.  Recorder is now ready to record with only the hydrophone on channel 1

#### **Setting the Date and Time**

The date/time should be correctly set. If it is not, complete these steps to check the date/time and correct it.

1.  Press Menu button on left side of the recorder
2.  Use scroll wheel on left side of recorder to navigate to SYSTEM, press scroll wheel in to select
3.  Select DATE/TIME and press scroll wheel
4.  Use the scroll wheel to set the year, month, day, and time
5.  Select OK and press scroll wheel

#### **Using Stamina Mode**

If you are anticipating that battery levels will be a concern while in the field, you can switch to stamina mode to conserve power. 

1.  On the back of the recorder, open the battery compartment and switch to stamina mode on

This will lengthen the battery life to roughly 11 hours depending on usage. When using this mode, the recorder can only record/playback in WAV 44.1kHz/16-bit and MP43 formats. **This may limit some recorder function, see [manual](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/lit_files/263141.pdf) for more information.**\

![](images/hh_staminaMode.png)

#### **Changing the Folder Location**

You can manually select which folder you would like the recorder to save files to. It will default to Folder 1 (1 out of 10), and will save a new file for each recording. To change the file, follow these steps;

1.  Press the menu button on right side of the recorder
2.  Use scroll wheel to select folder
3.  Choose which folder you want to store your recordings in and push down on the scroll wheel to select

When you are done recording, you can move the files out of one of the preset folders, into your own folder with a more descriptive naming format.

## **How to Use Handheld Hydrophone in the field**
