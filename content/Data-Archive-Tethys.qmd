## Accessing Data

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES deployment metadata and detection data are archived locally in our lab's Tethys database.

The Tethys database is saved locally on the DON server (*Z:/ANALYSIS/Tethys*). Tethys has multiple ways to access/visualize the database, but these directions will only include opening the web client interface (main web app and Data Explorer).

### Tethys Web Interface

1.  Open Tethys batch file (*Z:/ANALYSIS/Tethys/databases/metadata/tethys.bat*)

    ::: callout-note
    This may take a while to load if you have never accessed this database or if you are accessing it remotely (up to an hour)
    :::

2.  Once the *tethys.bat* file has loaded, you should see a website address in the command window to open the web interface (this will include your computer name)

3.  Navigate to the web address and you should see the following screen

4.  Follow the Tethys documentation for [interacting with the web client](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/distribution/current-docs/WebClient.pdf)

### Tethys Data Explorer

::: callout-important
## The Tethys server (*tethys.bat*) must be running to use the Data Explorer
:::

1.  Navigate to the Data Explorer batch file (*Z:/ANALYSIS/Tethys/DataExplorer/data_explorer.bat*)
2.  If you are using swc-srankin1-d desktop, skip to step 5. Otherwise, proceed to step 3
3.  Right click on *data_explorer.bat, and select edit*
4.  Update the server argument to point to your computer/server name (changing "*..*/python*39/python.exe data_explorer.py --server <http://swc-srankin1-d.nmfs.local:9779>*" to "*..*/python*39/python.exe data_explorer.py --server <http://swc-kourtney-l.nmfs.local:9779>*"
5.  Save and close, and double click on *data_explorer.bat* to run the batch file
6.  There will be a series of automatic queries to access the database, and then you should see a prompt to open the Data Explorer at another web address. It should be [*http://127.0.0.1:8050/*](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)
7.  See Tethys [Data Explorer documentation](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/distribution/current-docs/DataExplorerManual.pdf) for more information
