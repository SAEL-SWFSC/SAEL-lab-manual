## Local Data Archive

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES data are locally stored on shared servers/drives.

All raw data and current analysis for ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES can be found on the DON

(\\swc-storage4-s\MMTD-ACOUSTICS)

All archived projects and a copy of ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES SUD files can be found on the PAM Synology arrays (\\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam, \\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam2)

## Public Repositories

SAEL Github Organization (https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC) is for new and recent repositories.

Specific publicly accessible projects include:

-   Adrift in the California Current ([Github Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift) and [website](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/))

-   [Beaked Whales from NOAA's CCES 2018 Survey (Figshare)](https://figshare.com/projects/Beaked_Whale_Acoustic_Events_from_Drifting_Acoustic_Recordings_during_NOAA_s_CCES_2018_Survey/94511)

## NCEI Data Archive

### Accessing Data

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL raw data are publicly accessible through [NCEI Passive Acoustics Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data). Sound level metrics can also be accessed from this archive.

Users can access data through the [interactive map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/) or request data using [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/passive_acoustic_monitoring?pli=1&project=ggn-nmfs-pamdata-prod-1)

### Submitting Data

#### Passive Packer

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL data were packaged using a combination of automated scripts and the NCEI Passive Packer tool. Several automation scripts were used to create Passive Packer ready databases from our deployment details metadata. Detailed methods can be found [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/NCEI.html).

#### PACE

Future PAM data (CalCurCEAS 2024, gliders, etc) will be packaged and submitted using NCEI's new [Passive Acoustic Collection Engine (PACE)](https://github.com/CI-CMG/pace). These methods are being developed and will be accessible [here](https://github.com/Kourtney-Burger/NCEI-PACE-Data-Archive) once completed.

## PACM

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL marine mammal detection data are archived and available on the [Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/). Archive methods can be found [here](https://github.com/Kourtney-Burger/ADRIFT-PACM).

## Tethys

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES deployment metadata and detection data are archived locally in our lab's [Tethys database](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/). See [Tethys SAEL GitHub repository](https://github.com/asimonis/TethysSAEL) and our [detailed methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/TethysDeployments.html) for more information.

## OBIS Seamap

We are no longer storing marine mammal detection data in the OBIS database. OBIS specific processing scripts for beaked whales are available [here](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PAMpal/blob/735dfec50b3c6feaa8772765d752e8260363a2c5/devel/OBIS_Functions.R).

## InPort Metadata Archive

### Overview

Per Fisheries Information Management and Data Documentation policy and procedural directives, all Fisheries data must be inventoried with complete metadata in InPort, our official metadata repository. PAM data is complicated, and there is no standard for posting metadata to InPort. Given that detailed metadata is archived to NCEI, SWFSC will post all data related to PAM Deployments/data collection efforts and ensure there is a link to access additional data/metadata via NCEI and PACM.

### Access Metadata

You do not need an account to view metadata on InPort. Open the [InPort home page](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/) and enter keywords to search the library

### Submitting Metadata

To submit metadata, you first must contact your center InPort Librarians to get an account set up. To submit to the [SWFSC library](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/organization/SWFSC), contact Arnold Ammann (arnold.ammann\@noaa.gov), Gabriel Arce (Gabriel.Arce\@noaa.gov), or Thanh T Vu (thanh.vu\@noaa.gov).

Follow detailed methods [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Slides/InPortDataArchiveMethods.qmd) to submit metadata according to InPort expectations
