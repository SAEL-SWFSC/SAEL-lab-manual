## Public Repositories (*in progress)*

[SAEL Github Organization](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC) is for new and
recent repositories. [NOAA Fisheries National PAM
Network](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_National_Network/)

#### *Specific publicly accessible projects include:*

-   Adrift in the California Current ([Github
    Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift){target="_blank"}
    and [website](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/))

-   [Beaked Whales from NOAA's CCES 2018 Survey
    (Figshare)](https://figshare.com/projects/Beaked_Whale_Acoustic_Events_from_Drifting_Acoustic_Recordings_during_NOAA_s_CCES_2018_Survey/94511)

-   [CalCurCEAS 2024 Drifter
    Analysis](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/CalCurCEAS-2024-Drifter-Analysis)

-   [Towed Array Metadata
    Archive](https://github.com/shannonrankin/dataWrangling_towedArray)

## NCEI Data Archive

NCEI hosts a [Passive Acoustic Data
Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data),
where all ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL deployment metadata, raw audio data,
and soundscape metrics are publicly available. CalCurCEAS 2024 raw audio
data will be accessible in this archive once it has been cleared.

Users can access data through the [interactive
map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/) or request
data using [Google Cloud
Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/passive_acoustic_monitoring?pli=1&project=ggn-nmfs-pamdata-prod-1)

See [NCEI Data Archive
section](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-Archive-NCEI.html)
for more information and detailed archive methods

## PACM, Makara

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL marine mammal detection data are archived
and available on the [Passive Acoustic Cetacean
Map](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/). Additional metadata
will be uploaded as it is compiled and quality-checked.

PACM Archive methods can be found
[here](https://github.com/Kourtney-Burger/ADRIFT-PACM).

## Tethys

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, CCES, and CalCurCEAS deployment metadata and
detection data are archived locally in our lab's [Tethys
database](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/). Additional metadata will be
uploaded as it is compiled and quality-checked.

See the [Tethys
section](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-Archive-Tethys.html)
for detailed archive methods and more information.

## InPort Metadata Archive

Per Fisheries Information Management and Data Documentation policy and
procedural directives, all Fisheries data must be inventoried with
complete metadata in InPort, our official metadata repository. PAM data
is complicated, and there is no standard for posting metadata to InPort.
Given that detailed metadata is archived to NCEI, SWFSC will post all
data related to PAM Deployments/data collection efforts and ensure there
is a link to access additional data/metadata via NCEI and PACM.

See [InPort
section](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-Archive-InPort.html)
for more information on accessing and submitting metadata.

## OBIS Seamap

We are no longer storing marine mammal detection data in the OBIS
database. OBIS specific processing scripts for beaked whales are
available
[here](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PAMpal/blob/735dfec50b3c6feaa8772765d752e8260363a2c5/devel/OBIS_Functions.R).
