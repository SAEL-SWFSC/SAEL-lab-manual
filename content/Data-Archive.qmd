## Local Data Archive

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES data are locally stored on shared servers/drives.

All raw data and current analysis for ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES can be found on the DON

(\\swc-storage4-s\MMTD-ACOUSTICS)

All archived projects and a copy of ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES SUD files can be found on the PAM Synology arrays (\\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam, \\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam2)

## Public Repositories
SAEL Github Organization (https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC) is for new and recent repositories.

Specific publicly accessible projects include:
- Adrift in the California Current ([Github Repository[(https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift)] and [website](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/))
- [Beaked Whales from NOAA's CCES 2018 Survey (Figshare)](https://figshare.com/projects/Beaked_Whale_Acoustic_Events_from_Drifting_Acoustic_Recordings_during_NOAA_s_CCES_2018_Survey/94511)




## NCEI Data Archive

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL raw data is publicly accessible through [NCEI Passive Acoustics Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data). Sound level metrics can also be accessed from this archive.

All data were packaged using a combination of automated scripts and the NCEI Passive Packer tool. Several automation scripts were used to create Passive Packer ready databases from our deployment details metadata. Detailed methods can be found [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/NCEI.html).

## PACM

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL marine mammal detection data are archived and available on the [Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/). Archive methods can be found [here](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/PACM.html). 

## Tethys

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES deployment metadata and detection data are archived in our lab's [Tethys database](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/). See [Tethys SAEL GitHub repository](https://github.com/asimonis/TethysSAEL) and our [detailed methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-analysis-methods/content/DataArchive/TethysDeployments.html) for more information.

## OBIS Seamap

We are no longer storing marine mammal detection data in the OBIS database. OBIS specific processing scripts for beaked whales are available [here](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PAMpal/blob/735dfec50b3c6feaa8772765d752e8260363a2c5/devel/OBIS_Functions.R). 

## InPort Metadata Archive
Per Fisheries Information Management and Data Documentation policy and procedural directives, all Fisheries data must be inventoried with complete metadata in InPort, our official metadata repository. PAM data is complicated, and there is no standard for posting metadata to InPort. Given that detailed metadata is archived to NCEI, SWFSC will post all data related to PAM Deployments/data collection efforts and ensure there is a link to access additional data/metadata via NCEI and PACM. 

To submit metadata, you must first create an Account by contacting one of these SWFSC InPort Librarians: Arnold Ammann (arnold.ammann@noaa.gov), Gabriel Arce (Gabriel.Arce@noaa.gov), or Thanh T Vu (thanh.vu@noaa.gov).

Login, Navigate to the [SWFSC Organization page](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/hierarchy/1370), and you can then navigate to Passive Acoustics (as long as you are logged in).

Then select "Add Child Item" (on the right). 

Complete Metadata according to expectations (see [InPort Help](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/help))
