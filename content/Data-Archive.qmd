## Local Data Archive

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES data are locally stored on shared servers/drives.

All raw data and current analysis for ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES can be found on the DON

(\\swc-storage4-s\MMTD-ACOUSTICS)

All archived projects and a copy of ADRIFT, PASCAL, and CCES SUD files can be found on the PAM Synology arrays (\\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam, \\\\SWC-CMAP-N\\pam2)

## Public Repositories (*in progress)*

*Add links to PAM national repo and OST*

[SAEL Github Organization](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC) is for new and recent repositories.

Specific publicly accessible projects include:

-   Adrift in the California Current ([Github Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift){target="_blank"} and [website](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/))

-   [Beaked Whales from NOAA's CCES 2018 Survey (Figshare)](https://figshare.com/projects/Beaked_Whale_Acoustic_Events_from_Drifting_Acoustic_Recordings_during_NOAA_s_CCES_2018_Survey/94511)

## Google Cloud Storage

*Link to GCP methods and archive (work in progress)*

## NCEI Data Archive

NCEI hosts a [Passive Acoustic Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data), where all ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL deployment metadata, raw audio data, and soundscape metrics are publicly available. CalCurCEAS 2024 raw audio data will be accessible in this archive once it has been cleared.

Users can access data through the [interactive map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/passive-acoustic-data/) or request data using [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/noaa-public/passive_acoustic_monitoring?pli=1&project=ggn-nmfs-pamdata-prod-1)

See NCEI section for more information and detailed archive methods

## PACM

All ADRIFT, CCES, and PASCAL marine mammal detection data are archived and available on the [Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/). Archive methods can be found [here](https://github.com/Kourtney-Burger/ADRIFT-PACM).

## Tethys

All ADRIFT, PASCAL, CCES, and CalCurCEAS deployment metadata and detection data are archived locally in our lab's [Tethys database](https://tethys.sdsu.edu/). See the [Tethys section](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-Archive-Tethys.html) for detailed archive methods and more information.

## InPort Metadata Archive

Per Fisheries Information Management and Data Documentation policy and procedural directives, all Fisheries data must be inventoried with complete metadata in InPort, our official metadata repository. PAM data is complicated, and there is no standard for posting metadata to InPort. Given that detailed metadata is archived to NCEI, SWFSC will post all data related to PAM Deployments/data collection efforts and ensure there is a link to access additional data/metadata via NCEI and PACM.

See InPort section for more information on accessing and submitting metadata

## OBIS Seamap

We are no longer storing marine mammal detection data in the OBIS database. OBIS specific processing scripts for beaked whales are available [here](https://github.com/TaikiSan21/PAMpal/blob/735dfec50b3c6feaa8772765d752e8260363a2c5/devel/OBIS_Functions.R).
