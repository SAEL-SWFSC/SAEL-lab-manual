There are many resources on the [Intranet](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/inside-swfsc/home/administrative/safety?pli=1&authuser=1). Some examples include the latest information on COVID-19, the NOAA Emergency Notification System, and the NOAA Safety Incident/Accident reporting home page. If you are working onsite (La Jolla) you should familiarize yourself with these links along with how to report an incident if one occurs.
