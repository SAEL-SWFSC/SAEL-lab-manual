## Zotero Group Libraries

Group libraries are a means of crowd-sourcing literature on specific
topics. Here we suggest how to create a new group library, and how to
join/participate in an existing group library.

### How to Join Existing Group Libraray

To find an existing group library, you can search on Zotero.

If you are interested in Acoustics specific libraries, you can use the
'reference' tag within [Bioacoustics Stack
Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references){target="_blank"}.

Click the red 'Join' button to add the library to your account

### Create a New Zotero Group Library

1.  Once Zotero is installed on your computer and you have a Zotero
    account, navigate to the [Zotero
    Groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups){target="_blank"} and select
    "Create New Group"

2.  If you intend to make this a publicly accessible Zotero Group,
    select and save the following settings

    -   Group Type = "Public Open"

    -   Library Reading = "Anyone on the internet"

    -   Library Editing = "Any group members"

    -   File Editing = "No group file storage"

### Share Your Group Library

Post in Bioacoustics Stack Exchange as a Question/Answer and tag as
'reference' (in addition to other relevant tags) so that this
information is searchable on the web and accessible to the public.

1.  Log into [Bioacoustics Stack
    Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com) or follow these
    instructions to create an account: [join bioacoustics stack
    exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com){target="\"_blank"}
2.  Post a question (or have a colleague post a question), similar to
    the examples below, and be sure to select the tag 'references' and
    any additional tag references. You can either answer your own
    question, or work with a colleague such that one of you asks the
    question, and then the other answers the question. Be sure to accept
    the answer once posted.
3.  Here are two examples to follow: [Soundscape Zotero Group
    Library](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/questions/1375/is-there-a-central-repository-for-soundscape-literature)
    and [PAM-Glider Group
    Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5642642/pam-gliders)

## Zotero and RStudio

You can integrate Zotero directly to your Quarto/RMarkdown document in
RStudio, or to your Microsoft Word document. Here are some basics for
using in Quarto/RMarkdown

### Choose CSL: [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/)

Use Zotero to download the csl file for the journal you want to use.

1.  Go to the Zotero Preferences menu (Zotero \> Preferences on Mac,
    Edit \> Preferences on PC)

2.  Click on the 'Cite' menu

3.  Below the list of pre-installed styles, click the link for 'Get
    additional styles'

4.  Search for your desired style in the provided search field

5.  Select the style you want to install

### Add CSL to Your yaml

``` R
title: "My Document" 
bibliography: references.bib 
csl: nature.csl
```

### Export Zotero Library to Your R Project

1.  Open Zotero and select a folder/library
2.  Click File \> Export Library...
3.  Select Format \> BibText and save the \*.bib file in your R project
    folder

### Add Your References Into the Document

#### Inline Citation: 

Citations are inserted into your document using square brackets and are
separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of an
'\@' symbol plus the citation identifier from the database. For example;

``` r
[@wickham2015]
```

#### Bibliography: 

A list of works cited will be automatically generated and placed in the
document if the style calls for it. You may insert divs such as this;

``` r
### References
```
