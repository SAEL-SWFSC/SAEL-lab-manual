## Zotero

Zotero is an open-source online reference manager, where references can be readily saved from Google scholar using a browser plugin.

Get started:

1.  Load [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and create a [login](https://www.zotero.org/user/login/).

2.  Create a [browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en) so that you can directly save google scholar citations to your online reference list.

3.  Link Rstudio to your Zotero library

Add to your Document:

1.  Use Zotero to download the csl file for the journal you want to use.

    -   Go to the Zotero Preferences menu (Zotero \> Preferences on Mac, Edit \> Preferences on PC).

    -   Click on the Cite menu. \...

    -   Below the list of pre-installed styles, click the link for Get additional styles\...

    -   Search for your desired style in the provided search field.

    -   Select the style you want to install.

2.  CSL: [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/)

    1.  Use Zotero to download the csl file for the journal you want to use.

        -   Go to the Zotero Preferences menu (Zotero \> Preferences on Mac, Edit \> Preferences on PC).

        -   Click on the Cite menu. \...

        -   Below the list of pre-installed styles, click the link for Get additional styles\...

        -   Search for your desired style in the provided search field.

        -   Select the style you want to install.

    2.  Add csl to your yaml

        \-\--
        title**:** "My Document"
        bibliography**:** references.bib
        csl**:** nature.csl
        \-\--

3.  Add your references into the document

    1.  Inline Citation: Citations are inserted into your document using square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of an '\@' symbol plus the citation identifier from the database. For example, [@wickham2015]

    2.  Bibliography: A list of works cited will be automatically generated and placed in the document if the style calls for it. You may insert divs such as this:

        \### References

        ::: {#refs}
        :::

## Zotero Group Libraries
Group libraries are a means of crowd-sourcing literature on specific topics. Here we suggest how to create a new group library, and how to join/participate in an existing group library.

1. Find and join an existing group library
To find an existing group library, you can search on Zotero or on 'reference' tag within [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references){target="_blank"}.

2. Create a new Zotero group library
   1. Once Zotero is installed on your computer and you have a Zotero account, navigate to the [Zotero Groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups){target="_blank"} and select "Create New Group".
   2. If you intend to make this a publicly accessible Zotero Group, select the following settings:
   Group Type = "Public Open"
   Library Reading = "Anyone on the internet"
   Library Editing = "Any group members"
   File Editing = "No group file storage"
   
   Then save settings
   
3. Post in Bioacoustics Stack Exchange as a Question/Answer and tag as 'reference' (in addition to other relevant tags) so that this information is searchable on the web and accessible to the public. 
   1. Log into [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com){target="_blank} or follow these instructions to create an account: [join bioacoustics stack exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com){target="_blank}
   2. Post a question (or have a colleague post a question), similar to these examples, and be sure to select the tag 'references' and any additional tag references.  You can either answer your own question, or work with a colleague such that one of you asks the question, and then the other answers the question. Be sure to accept the answer once posted. Here are two examples to follow:
   [Soundscape Zotero Group Library](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/questions/1375/is-there-a-central-repository-for-soundscape-literature)
   PAM-Glider Group Library[TBD]
