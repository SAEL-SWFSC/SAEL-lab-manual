The Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab conducts research using passive acoustic monitoring to support NOAA's management needs. We are part of the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division at [NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center) in La Jolla, California.

This lab manual serves as the go-to handbook for the behind-the-scenes information to support our science.
