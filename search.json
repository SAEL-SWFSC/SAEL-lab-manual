We are dedicated to providing an environment that cultivates and celebrates individual differences and recognizes these differences as integral to the scientific enterprise. We welcome members and collaborators of marginalized groups of all kinds, including but not limited to those based on race, color, physical appearance, gender identity and expression, nationality or ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, genetic characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, age, ancestry, marital status, family status, veteran status, socioeconomic status, or immigration status. We recognize that success in science requires an environment where all people feel secure in their personal identities.\nThe SAEL Lab Values also include:\n\nEthics, justice, and equity for research participants and researchers\nCommunication and respect\nOpen data and methods\nWillingness to teach and learn\nOpenness to fresh perspectives\nEffective mentoring as a way to increase access, equity and inclusion in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine)\nBringing your whole self, or as much as you want to bring, to the lab"

    "text": "SAEL Lab Best Practices\n\nCommunication\n\nWe hold lab meetings regularly in which all members are expected to attend if their schedule allows. During these meetings all members are expected to contribute by sharing progress reports, discussing challenges, and celebrating successes.\nWe use WebEx Teams for informal discussions between lab members and project teams. Similarly, we use Slack and Trello for some projects with external collaborators.\nAll lab members are expected to check & respond to email and Teams/Slack regularly\n\n\n\nCollaboration\n\nLab members and collaborators, including students, interns, volunteers, and other mentees, can expect respect, patience, and learning opportunities from each other.\nCollaborators are expected to be in regular communication with each other.\nAt the onset of a project, collaborators should discuss their expectations for the project and of each other, and establish a feedback system to evaluate progress along the way.\nCollaborators are encouraged to ask questions and seek understanding from each other.\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nLab members are expected to follow all safety protocols. If they are not sure of the protocol, then they should request this information.\nLab members should never feel obligated to perform a task that they do not feel is safe.\nLab members are encouraged to speak up if they feel they need training to perform a specific task safely.\nIf lab members have a safety concern, they should bring it up with the PI or the other lab members.\nIf a lab member feels their safety concerns are not being taken seriously, they can consult the SWFSC Safety Officer (marty.nelson@noaa.gov).\n\n\n\nHandling or resolving incivility, harassment, or assault\n\nMaintaining a positive lab culture requires efforts from our entire research group. We expect all lab members:\n\nTo familiarize themselves with the definitions of incivility, microaggressions, harassment, and assault, and refrain from these behaviors.\nTo use safe, responsive, and effective ways to respond to cases of incivility, harassment, and/or assault that they observe or learn of from a lab member.\nTo offer support to those who have been harmed.\nTo make it possible for those who have been harmed to return to normalcy and/or work as soon as they wish. Alternatively, depending on the wishes of the person who has been harmed, to create opportunities for rest or leave from work or school.\n\nLab members should consider resolving conflicts with each other through empathetic but direct conversation.\nIf someone is not comfortable discussing an issue with the lab member who caused them harm, they can bring it up with the PI to mediate a conversation. If they do not feel comfortable interacting with the person who has harmed them, nor the PI, they may contact the program supervisor (Jeff Moore, jeff.e.moore@noaa.gov), the deputy director (Robin LeRoux, robin.leroux@noaa.gov) or the division director (Dave Weller, dave.weller@noaa.gov). Contractors should contact their contracting agency and interns should contact the intern leadership.\nLastly, they may also may consider these resources:\n\nNOAA Sexual Assault & Sexual Harassment\nPhone: 866-288-6558\nWebsite & Online Chat: https://noaasashhelpline.org/offsite link\nMobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)\nText: 202-335-0265 NOAA Equal Employment Opportunity complaint and counseling options\n\nActs of incivility, harassment, or assault within our lab group will lead to swift sanctions for the person who has caused harm, up to and including expulsion from the laboratory group depending on the wishes of the person who was harmed, and the severity of the act.\n\n\n\nOther important resources:\n\nSWFSC Team for Inclusion Diversity and Equity TIDE)\nSWFSC Emergency Plan\nSWFSC COVID Reintegration Plan\nOnline Guide to the Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM\nNOAA Office of Inclusion and Civil Rights\nNOAA Fisheries Diversity & Inclusion\nNOAA Employee Resource & Affinity Groups\nNOAA Employee Assistance Program\n\nAvailable for NOAA employees & contractors: 3 free phone counseling sessions to identify & resolve specific issues of concern"

    "text": "You can create your own website that looks like a ‘book’ by copying an existing template in Github and editing it in RStudio.\n\nPrepare to do Great Things!\n\nLoad Software: Github Desktop\nLoad Software: RStudio (v2022.07.2 build 576 or later)\nLoad Software: R\nCreate a Github Login\n\nCopy a template of Great Things!\nCopy an existing template to your own Github account. Go to NOAA Quarto Template and copy template to your Github Repository following the directions on the README.md. Give it an appropriate name and make sure it is PUBLIC.\nCopy to your desktop to make it a Greater Thing!\nUsing Github Desktop, Clone repository using URL (File-> Clone Repository). Copy the URL of your repository site (the URL of your copy of the Great Things Repository on your github account), and save project to your Documents-> Github folder (use defaults). See this Introduction to Git/Github tutorial for more help.\nUse RStudio to Modify Great Thing to make it Greater!\nIn RStudio, in the top right corner, select the project dropdown to Add New R Project from an Existing Project– and browse to select the appropriate folder in Documents-> Github. Examine the documents:\n\nREADME.md\nThis is the README file that will appear on your repository page.\nindex.qmd\nThis will serve as your ‘home’ page for the web-book that is created\ncontents folder\nThis folder will contain the ‘pages’ (chapters) for your web-book\n_quarto.yml\nThis will define the layout of your web-book\n(Insert picture of Layout)\n\nModify README.md\nIf you are using the latest version of RStudio (with quarto), you can modify your file using the Source Code or the Visual Editor. This is an RMarkdown file, so you can use R markdown language, or, if you prefer, you can use the visual editor which is more user-friendly. If you copy/paste an existing document into the visual editor, much of the existing formatting will be retained.\nModify and Rename files in Contents Folder\nEach of the existing qmd (Quarto) files in the contents folder have additional instructions to help you format your ‘book’ in Quarto. You may want to keep them, or you can always review the original template web-page for this information. Read the ‘Add Content’ page here to understand the minimal information you need for each of these pages in your contents folder.\nFor each page in your website (or chapter in your book), you will want to have a qmd file in this folder. You can open one of the existing qmd files and File-> Save As and save it as another name. Retain the minimal information needed for your page (see the Add Contents page), and then add your content using either the source code or visual editor. Make sure you SAVE each file when you are finished!\nModify _quarto.yml file\nThe _quarto.yml file identifies the structure of the web-book. Make changes to the website (Title, site & repo URL), the Sidebar (link to your preferred logo, link the globe icon to your website and link the github icon to your github URL and rename both of these). Finally– you will want to identify the contents.\nThe contents are each of your chapters (or web- pages). Each chapter has two lines of information:\n\nhref: refers to the name of the relevant qmd file (located in the contents folder).\ntext: this is the text you will see on the sidebar of the web-book.\nThe first contents page (home page) will link to the index.qmd file (in the main folder). The others will be in the contents folder, and therefore their name should be ‘contents/filename.qmd’ (where filename is the name of that qmd file).\n\nRender & View the Web-book\nTo Render the document, open the index.qmd file (in the main folder) and click on the ‘Render’ icon near the top (to the right of the save button). Look in the Terminal (lower left section of RStudio) for any errors. Most errors may be due to typos or unsaved modifications. If you still have errors, save everything & reopen RStudio & run again. If you still have errors, go through file by file!\nTo view the rendered document, open the _site folder, click on the index.html and select ‘View in Web Browser’. Ensure that everything looks as you would expect. You may need to modify, render, view, repeat until it is good. Be sure your project is saved.\nCommit & Push to Github\nOpen Github Desktop and open your project (if it is not already opened). Github desktop will identify the changes you made. At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select ‘commit’. Once the commit goes through– select ‘Push to Origin’ at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.\nOpen your Github repository and check out your Great Things!"

Be detailed. Consider doing smaller changes/commits to keep track of things.\nCreate a project board in Github to identify tasks in your project (to do, doing, done!). Retain these for future review.\nUse Issues to document discussions, modifications, and workflow. Link Issues to tasks in your Project Board.\nWhen you reach milestones in your work (say a draft for author review), create a Version in Github. This will help future you go back in time to a previous version of your work.\n\nThings to remember as you work:\n\nDocument everything! Assume you are documenting every detail for someone who is absolutely new to your work and needs to follow your methods exactly.
