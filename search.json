    "text": "Sonobuoys are expendable drifting recorders with vector sensing hydrophones deployed at depth, and signal is transmitted via radio frequency from the buoy to a nearby receiver for recording. Surplus Navy sonobuoys have been provided periodically for our shipboard surveys.\nIn 2019 we completed research funded by the Navy’s Living Marine Resources to study the potential to use sonobuoys during large scale surveys for population estimation of marine mammals. During this dedicated research project, our understanding of the strengths and limitations of sonobuoys was expanded, and we identified a few myths that had been transmitted through the bioacoustics community. In an effort to share learned best practices, the following report was developed.",

To expand on these efforts, PIFSC and SWFSC will lead a 3 year effort to accelerate the transition to operations for PAM-based glider surveys. The work will be focused in the Pacific initially because these Centers are ready to act and they are collectively responsible for the largest area under NMFS jurisdiction, have acute shortages of adequate shiptime, and must find alternative survey modalities to maintain their assessment operations. Despite the regional focus, the goal will be to develop a Research to Operations plan that can be adapted or applied in other regions seeking to implement PAM-equipped glider surveys to support their marine mammal assessments. The effort includes:\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild capacity to sustain glider operations. PIFSC and SWFSC will increase capacity to sustain PAM-glider operations through support for glider technicians at each Center and for pilot and technician training. The Pacific-wide R2O plan will include considerations of operational costs for conducting PAM-glider surveys into the future.\nIn-water instrumentation testing of several PAM-glider systems with the goal of examining hardware and sensor choices and how these choices may vary based on regional differences in assessment needs and oceanographic realities.\nConcurrent glider and shipboard surveys. We will deploy several PAM-equipped gliders in association with two large-scale assessment surveys- PacMAPPS west coast in 2024 and PacMAPPS Hawaiʻi in 2025. These surveys provide an opportunity to collect glider datasets that can be compared alongside traditional cetacean survey data to guide future survey design and analytical advancements. These surveys happen infrequently, such that this is a time-sensitive opportunity to begin validation of glider-based work.\nDevelop Spatial Modeling Methods. We will initiate development of statistical models to accommodate marine mammal acoustic detection data from PAM Gliders, facilitating adoption of these methods to address our stock assessment needs.\n\nThis is a new and ongoing effort, and updates can be found on the NOAA Fisheries PAM-Equipped Glider Research site.",

    "text": "This document will serve as a working draft for the management of lithium batteries. The following bullet points are the ones we discussed today, please feel free to add or make changes to any section according to NOAA, OMAO, and the State of California regulations.\nHere is a link to Safety Protocol for Flooded SoundTraps.\n\nSWFSC Li Battery Management\n\nPurpose\nThe intent of this document is to provide employees and contractors of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFCS) with guidelines that will allow personnel to safely handle, ship, store, dispose of, and respond to Lithium (Li) and Li-ion battery emergency situations.\nExtreme caution must be exercised when managing Li and Li-ion batteries within the center or conducting field operations due to the potential for fire, damage, or injury to personnel or property if misused or improperly handled. To prevent injury, it is imperative that employers and employees understand the basic function, hazards and safe use of Li and Li-ion battery powered devices.\nProcurement\nLi and Li-batteries can cause injury if they have design defects, are made of low quality materials, are assembled incorrectly, are used or recharged improperly, or are damaged during shipment or handling by the consumer. When purchasing Li batteries please use the following best practices guidelines. While the list is not exhaustive, it provides SWFCS the ability to ensure that the Li batteries purchased are of the highest quality available:\n\nPurchase batteries from a reputable manufacturer, supplier, or use a preferred supplier\nEnsure that the batteries are tested in accordance with an OSHA recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NLTR) and meet industry standards\nAvoid batteries that have been shipped without protective packaging (i.e., hard plastic casing or similar protective measures)\nInspect batteries upon receipt and safely dispose of damaged batteries\nCheck to ensure that a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) particular to the battery ordered has been shipped alongside the batteries; store this in a binder accessible to those with access with the Li or Li-ion batteries\nDo not over purchase in size or volume\n\nHandling\nObserve the following guidelines when handling Li and Li-ion batteries:\n\nKeep batteries from contacting conductive materials, water, seawater, strong oxidizers, and strong acids\nDo not place batteries in direct sunlight, on hot surfaces or in hot locations\nInspect batteries for signs of damage before use. Do not use batteries if there is any evidence of leakage or deformity. Never use and promptly and properly dispose of damaged or “puffy” batteries\nConsult the SDS for precautions to use when handling leaking batteries.\nKeep all flammable materials away from operating area\nAllow time for cooling before charging a battery that is still warm from usage and refrain from using a battery that is still warm from charging\nTurn off equipment if the battery becomes unexpectedly, or excessively hot. Wait for battery to cool before removing from equipment\nUse batteries only for the application for which they were designed. Only use lithium cells and batteries in approved equipment\nKeep batteries in their original packaging until ready for use\nUse special care in handling batteries. Make sure they are not punctured, crushed, mishandled, disassembled or exposed to storage temperatures exceeding the maximum specified temperature on the product’s safety data sheet\nRemove jewelry items such as rings, wristwatches, pendants, etc., that could come in contact with the battery terminals\n\nStorage\n\nStorage cabinets must conform to the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)  30 or equivalent: 18 gauge sheet steel, double wall, locked, and labeled with a list of contents. Maintain at least 2” clearance around the cabinet for ventilation and fire control\nThe cabinet location must be protected from forklifts, hand trucks, overhead loads, and other devices that could result in cell damage to the storage cabinet and the batteries while in storage\nCabinet should be isolated from flammable liquids and hazardous waste. No other hazardous or combustible material should be stored in or on the cabinet.\nLabel all storage cabinets with the applicable hazardous materials placard.\nStorage areas with more than 5 pounds of metallic lithium must be labeled with the appropriate placard in accordance with NFPA 704 diamond that is at least 18” on each side with applicable information (e.g. Health 3, Flammability 2, Reactivity 2, and Special Hazard W); see Attachment A.\nRemove batteries from device for long-term storage\nStore batteries in a lithium safe guard or bag to prevent damage to other batteries in the case of fire or ignition\nStore batteries in a cool, dry, and ventilated area\nStore the batteries at temperatures between 5°C and 20°C (41°F and 68°F)\nSeparate fresh and depleted batteries/cells\nAvoid bulk-storage in non-laboratory areas, such as offices\nVisually inspect storage areas weekly\nMaintain a binder of SDS pertaining to the specific batteries near the storage cabinets\n\nCharging\nLi batteries are grouped into two general categories: primary and secondary batteries. \n\nPrimary batteries consist of single-use cells containing metallic lithium anodes, are non-rechargeable and are commonly known as Li metal batteries\n\nNEVER charge a primary battery\nStore one time use (primary batteries) separately from secondary batteries; properly label the outer packaging to prevent this mistake\n\nSecondary batteries contain an intercalated Li compound for the anode and cathode. These batteries are rechargeable and are commonly referred to as Li-ion batteries\n\nUse the following guidelines when charging secondary batteries.\n\nWhen applicable, use Lithium Polymer (LiPo) bags to charge batteries\nUse only lithium-specific chargers to safely charge cells or battery packs\nCharge secondary batteries to approximately 50% - 70% of capacity before long-term storage. Most chargers will have a designated “storage-mode” dependent on the voltage, type of battery, and how many cells it is\nDisconnect batteries immediately if during operation or charging they:\n\nEmit an unusual smell\nEmit smoke\nOverheat or become abnormally hot\nThe battery begins to swell\nBehave abnormally\n\nDo not leave batteries and chargers unattended during charging. Charging should be in a manned space or remotely monitored\nRemove batteries from chargers promptly after charging is complete. Do not use the charger as a storage device/location\nDo not parallel charge batteries of varying age and charge status\nCheck voltage before parallel charging. All batteries should be within 0.5 volts of each other\nIf a battery cannot maintain a charge for its normal duration, even when properly charged, remove the battery from service and dispose of properly\n\nShipping:\nFederal regulations about shipping Li batteries are updated every year as new hazards are identified. Due to these yearly updates, this document will not provide specific shipping instructions. SWFSC personnel needing to ship Li batteries must take the appropriate International Aviation Transportation Association (IATA), International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG), or Department of Transportation (DOT) training, attend and update their training certification every 2 - 3 years, and provide a copy of the certificate to Marty Nelson, Safety Engineer, SECO. Trained personnel will also adhere to the Federal regulations that govern the specific mode of transportation to be used.\nDisposal\n\nIn California, Li-metal/ion batteries are considered hazardous waste and need to be disposed of properly. All Li batteries types (AAA, AA, C, D, button cell, 9-volt, etc), whether primary or secondary, must be recycled or taken to a household hazardous waste disposal facility, a universal waste handler (e.g., storage facility or broker), or an authorized recycling facility\nOptions for recycling\ni.

Secure E-Waste Solutions https://www.sesrecycling.com/\n\nEmergency Response\n\nPreventative Measures\nPlease follow the steps outlined below to ensure that any batteries showing signs of misuse are handled and disposed of properly. Proper PPE will be worn when taking preventative measures including a lab coat, rubber gloves, and safety glasses.\ni. If batteries are showing evidence of thermal runaway failure, be very cautious; the gases may be flammable and toxic and failure modes can be hazardous\nii. Disconnect the battery (if possible)\niii. Remove the battery from the equipment/device (if possible)\niv.  Place the battery in a metal or other container away from combustibles\nFires\nIn the event that a Li metal or ion battery were to catch fire, a room could fill quickly with dense white smoke and the fire will be difficult to extinguish. The fumes and smoke from the fire can cause severe irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. All precautions must be taken to limit exposure to these fumes. The following actions should be taken:\ni. Evacuate personnel from all areas affected by the smoke and fumes and sound the fire alarm\nii. Assess the scene for unsafe conditions for yourself and others\niii. Assist victim, determine extent of injury, and administer first aid if appropriate and you are trained\niv. Ventilate the affected areas and continue ventilation until the odor is no longer detected\nv. Use a CO2 (Class BC) or dry chemical (Class ABC) fire extinguisher\nvi. Don’t use a Class D fire extinguisher \nvii. If possible, direct someone to call 9-911 for emergency response on one of the facility phones\n\nReporting\n\nAlert\ni.

    "text": "Updating the Database\nThere are several methods to update existing documents in the database. These directions will cover Matlab based XQuery methods and a simple reuploading method.\n\nXQueries\nTo update existing database entries, you can pass Matlab an XQuery that points to a specific node and includes an updated value for that node. An example XQuery and sample Matlab script are included here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningMake sure you have backed up a copy of your database before attempting to update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a new XQuery\nFollow the format of the example XQuery here\n\nIdentify the specific node you want to change. You can find deployments and detection files in the Tethys web browser (click on Tethys icon in top right and select an option from ‘Document listings per collection’). In the example file, we are interested in the audio sensor number from ADRIFT 102 and we want to change it from 856142 to 856141. Change this information to match your node of interest\nSave the XQuery with a descriptive name to ‘Z:’\n\n\n\nRunning Query and Updated Database\n\nOpen the Tethys batch file (see directions here) and check the server name. You should see something like http://YourComputerName.local:9779 or just http://localhost:9779\nOpen TethysXQueryExample.m script in Matlab\nAdd a new Matlab path with subfolders to “Z:”. This will point you to the correct path in the SAEL lab Tethys database and allow you to use Tethys functions and commands\nRun line 5 in the script to initiate connection to the database. If your server name from step 1 is different then ‘localhost:9779’ you will need to change the second argument from ‘localhost’ to the name of your server (example YourComputerName.local)\nTest the connection to the database by running line 7. If you see a new item in the workspace title DeploymentInfo with all deployments listed you can proceed to step 6\nEnsure the path to the .xq file is correct and run line 12\nTo check if the database was uploaded, you can navigate to the specific node using the Tethys web interface query tools\n\n\n\n\nReuploading Data\nYou can also update the database by editing the existing document and reuploading it to the Database.\n\nDeployment Example\nIn this example, I want to change the ADRIFT 102 audio sensor channel 1 number from 856142 to 856141\n\nFind and download the ADRIFT 102 deployment worksheet (all deployment worksheets should be stored here\nOpen the worksheet and navigate to the SensorNumber field on the Sensor tab. Change the sensor number for channel 1\nSave the worksheet and ensure the updated one is reuploaded here\nFollow the directions here to import the updated deployment worksheet using one of the methods described. Make sure the ‘Overwrite existing’ box is selected to add your updates to the database\nTo check if the database was uploaded, you can navigate to the specific node using the Tethys web interface query tools",

The hydrophones are from High Tech, Inc., with the top hydrophone being an HTI-92WB and 5 meters below that, a HTI-96min.\nEach hydrophone has a specific sensitivity and when coupled with the recorder, the array will have an overall system sensitivity. Hydrophone sensitivity and recorder sensitivity/gain values can be found in our inventory here. For soundscape analysis and system calibration, overall system sensitivity values for past deployments can be found here.\nFor new deployments, the hydrophone sensitivity can be calculated using the CheckSystemSensitivity.r script here.",

Do not put excess pressure on or crush the hydrophone**\n\nRemove hydrophone, preamplifier, and Handy Recorder from box\nConnect the hydrophone to the preamplifier by plugging the yellow labeled end of the hydrophone to the preamplifier box and twist the hydrophone cable to lock them together \nConnect the other end of the preamplifier to the Handy Recorder, align three pins from preamplifier to the channel 1 recorder port, and click into place\nTurn on Handy Recorder using power button on the left side, and ensure the four channel (4CH) recording option is selected at the top (see help steps below in Recording Only With One Hydrophone (Single-Channel Recording)\n\nPress the record button once and lightly tap on each of the two attached microphones on top of the recorder, as well as the hydrophone\nCheck for signal changes on the recorder screen\n\nEach of the three recording bars (MIC L & R, IN 1) should be moving and the record button should be blinking red\nIf there is no signal change for the hydrophone, follow steps in Recorder Not Displaying Signal Change From Hydrophone section\nIf testing hydrophone in water, ensure only the end of the hydrophone is in the water, and no other components, including the preamplifier and recorder, get wet\n\n\nOnce both microphones and the hydrophone has been tested, press the stop button and turn off the recorder\nCarefully remove the preamplifier/hydrophone cable from the recorder (press metal tab on back of recorder port while pulling the cable)\nUntwist the hydrophone, pull cable from preamplifier, and return all components to hydrophone and recorder cases\n\n\n\nSetting Up and Changing Settings for Handy Recorder\n\nLoading an SD Card\nAn SD card is required to record and save on the Handy Recorder\n\nMake sure recorder power is off\nInsert SD card into slot on right side of the recorder\n\nCautions\n\nSD card must be 16MB to 32GB\nIf “Format Card” appears on the display startup, the SD card must be formatted for the device. Press DIAL and select YES to format the SD card for the H4n Pro\nClear SD card before recording to ensure there is ample space\n\n\n\nSingle-Channel Recording\nRecorder should be set up to record on 4 channels (two attached microphones and two channel ports on the bottom of the recorder where the hydrophone is plugged in). This is useful in the event you want to narrate what is happening at the surface while the hydrophone is recording (i.e. whales breaching at this time). Follow these steps to change to single channel recording, to only record with the hydrophone, not the attached microphones. (Follow steps and picture below)\n\nClick menu button on right side of Handy Recorder\nUse scroll wheel to go to Mode option and press scroll button in to select Mode\nUse scroll button to move to Stereo (single channel) and push scroll button in to select it \nRecorder screen should return to main screen and STEREO light indicator should be on\n\nPress the 1 button on bottom left of recorder, and channel 1 & 2 light indicators should turn on (may be on already) \n\nEnsure mic button is not lit up \n\nRecorder is now ready to record with only the hydrophone on channel 1\n\n\n\nSetting the Date and Time\nThe date/time should be correctly set. If it is not, complete these steps to check the date/time and correct it.\n\nPress Menu button on left side of the recorder\nUse scroll wheel on left side of recorder to navigate to SYSTEM, press scroll wheel in to select\nSelect DATE/TIME and press scroll wheel\nUse the scroll wheel to set the year, month, day, and time\nSelect OK and press scroll wheel\n\n\n\nUsing Stamina Mode\nIf you are anticipating that battery levels will be a concern while in the field, you can switch to stamina mode to conserve power. \n\nOn the back of the recorder, open the battery compartment and switch to stamina mode on\n\nThis will lengthen the battery life to roughly 11 hours depending on usage. When using this mode, the recorder can only record/playback in WAV 44.1kHz/16-bit and MP43 formats. This may limit some recorder function, see manual for more information.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the Folder Location\nYou can manually select which folder you would like the recorder to save files to. It will default to Folder 1 (1 out of 10), and will save a new file for each recording. To change the file, follow these steps;\n\nPress the menu button on right side of the recorder\nUse scroll wheel to select folder\nChoose which folder you want to store your recordings in and push down on the scroll wheel to select\n\nWhen you are done recording, you can move the files out of one of the preset folders, into your own folder with a more descriptive naming format.",

Similarly, we use Slack and Trello for some projects with external collaborators.\nAll lab members are expected to check & respond to email and Teams/Slack regularly\n\n\n\nCollaboration\n\nLab members and collaborators, including students, interns, volunteers, and other mentees, can expect respect, patience, and learning opportunities from each other.\nCollaborators are expected to be in regular communication with each other.\nAt the onset of a project, collaborators should discuss their expectations for the project and of each other, and establish a feedback system to evaluate progress along the way.\nCollaborators are encouraged to ask questions and seek understanding from each other.\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nLab members are expected to follow all safety protocols. If they are not sure of the protocol, then they should request this information.\nLab members should never feel obligated to perform a task that they do not feel is safe.\nLab members are encouraged to speak up if they feel they need training to perform a specific task safely.\nIf lab members have a safety concern, they should bring it up with the PI or the other lab members.\nIf a lab member feels their safety concerns are not being taken seriously, they can consult the SWFSC Safety Officer Ravi Shiwmangal (ravi.shiwmangal@noaa.gov).\n\n\n\nHandling or resolving incivility, harassment, or assault\n\nMaintaining a positive lab culture requires efforts from our entire research group. We expect all lab members:\n\nTo familiarize themselves with the definitions of incivility, microaggressions, harassment, and assault, and refrain from these behaviors.\nTo use safe, responsive, and effective ways to respond to cases of incivility, harassment, and/or assault that they observe or learn of from a lab member.\nTo offer support to those who have been harmed.\nTo make it possible for those who have been harmed to return to normalcy and/or work as soon as they wish. Alternatively, depending on the wishes of the person who has been harmed, to create opportunities for rest or leave from work or school.\n\nLab members should consider resolving conflicts with each other through empathetic but direct conversation.\nIf someone is not comfortable discussing an issue with the lab member who caused them harm, they can bring it up with the PI to mediate a conversation. If they do not feel comfortable interacting with the person who has harmed them, nor the PI, they may contact the program supervisor (Jeff Moore, jeff.e.moore@noaa.gov), the deputy director (Robin LeRoux, robin.leroux@noaa.gov) or the division director (Dave Weller, dave.weller@noaa.gov).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Southwest Fisheries Science Center initiated towed array research in the late 1990s using solid hydrophone arrays developed by Norris (Santa Barbara). Breakages at sea were common, and Jay Barlow began designing a custom towed hydrophone to provide more control over building and repairing equipment. The first towed hydrophones developed by SWFSC consisted of solid polyeurethane hydrophones molded onto cable (see Construction Guide). These solid hydrophones required a long and robust ‘tail’ to minimize ‘fish-tailing’, and yet damage to internal wires at the front end of the mold were common (this area acted as a ‘joint’, bending and eventually leading to wear on the internal wires). A need for more robust towed arrays with the ability to repair and replace internal components lead to the design of oil-filled towed hydrophone arrays (still in use today).\nLater, SWFSC conducted several efforts to develop a volumetric (tetrahedral) towed hydrophone array to allow for improved real-time localization. Initial efforts led by Jay Barlow led to successful tracking of beaked whales during SoCal Behavioral Response Studies (SoCal BRS), and later collaborations with external organizations via Small Business Innovation Research programs.\nUltimately, the need for real-time detection during surveys off the U.S. West Coast did not justify the resources required and SWFSC conducted their final towed array survey in 2016. All towed array equipment was transferred to other science centers still conducting towed array surveys, and ongoing improvement of towed array systems are being led by our colleagues at PIFSC.",
