    "text": "This document will serve as a working draft for the management of lithium batteries. The following bullet points are the ones we discussed today, please feel free to add or make changes to any section according to NOAA, OMAO, and the State of California regulations.\n\nSWFSC Li Battery Management\n\nPurpose\nThe intent of this document is to provide employees and contractors of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFCS) with guidelines that will allow personnel to safely handle, ship, store, dispose of, and respond to Lithium (Li) and Li-ion battery emergency situations.\nExtreme caution must be exercised when managing Li and Li-ion batteries within the center or conducting field operations due to the potential for fire, damage, or injury to personnel or property if misused or improperly handled. To prevent injury, it is imperative that employers and employees understand the basic function, hazards and safe use of Li and Li-ion battery powered devices.\nProcurement\nLi and Li-batteries can cause injury if they have design defects, are made of low quality materials, are assembled incorrectly, are used or recharged improperly, or are damaged during shipment or handling by the consumer. When purchasing Li batteries please use the following best practices guidelines. While the list is not exhaustive, it provides SWFCS the ability to ensure that the Li batteries purchased are of the highest quality available:\n\nPurchase batteries from a reputable manufacturer, supplier, or use a preferred supplier\nEnsure that the batteries are tested in accordance with an OSHA recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NLTR) and meet industry standards\nAvoid batteries that have been shipped without protective packaging (i.e., hard plastic casing or similar protective measures)\nInspect batteries upon receipt and safely dispose of damaged batteries\nCheck to ensure that a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) particular to the battery ordered has been shipped alongside the batteries; store this in a binder accessible to those with access with the Li or Li-ion batteries\nDo not over purchase in size or volume\n\nHandling\nObserve the following guidelines when handling Li and Li-ion batteries:\n\nKeep batteries from contacting conductive materials, water, seawater, strong oxidizers, and strong acids\nDo not place batteries in direct sunlight, on hot surfaces or in hot locations\nInspect batteries for signs of damage before use. Do not use batteries if there is any evidence of leakage or deformity. Never use and promptly and properly dispose of damaged or “puffy” batteries\nConsult the SDS for precautions to use when handling leaking batteries.\nKeep all flammable materials away from operating area\nAllow time for cooling before charging a battery that is still warm from usage and refrain from using a battery that is still warm from charging\nTurn off equipment if the battery becomes unexpectedly, or excessively hot. Wait for battery to cool before removing from equipment\nUse batteries only for the application for which they were designed. Only use lithium cells and batteries in approved equipment\nKeep batteries in their original packaging until ready for use\nUse special care in handling batteries. Make sure they are not punctured, crushed, mishandled, disassembled or exposed to storage temperatures exceeding the maximum specified temperature on the product’s safety data sheet\nRemove jewelry items such as rings, wristwatches, pendants, etc., that could come in contact with the battery terminals\n\nStorage\n\nStorage cabinets must conform to the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)  30 or equivalent: 18 gauge sheet steel, double wall, locked, and labeled with a list of contents. Maintain at least 2” clearance around the cabinet for ventilation and fire control\nThe cabinet location must be protected from forklifts, hand trucks, overhead loads, and other devices that could result in cell damage to the storage cabinet and the batteries while in storage\nCabinet should be isolated from flammable liquids and hazardous waste. No other hazardous or combustible material should be stored in or on the cabinet.\nLabel all storage cabinets with the applicable hazardous materials placard.\nStorage areas with more than 5 pounds of metallic lithium must be labeled with the appropriate placard in accordance with NFPA 704 diamond that is at least 18” on each side with applicable information (e.g. Health 3, Flammability 2, Reactivity 2, and Special Hazard W); see Attachment A.\nRemove batteries from device for long-term storage\nStore batteries in a lithium safe guard or bag to prevent damage to other batteries in the case of fire or ignition\nStore batteries in a cool, dry, and ventilated area\nStore the batteries at temperatures between 5°C and 20°C (41°F and 68°F)\nSeparate fresh and depleted batteries/cells\nAvoid bulk-storage in non-laboratory areas, such as offices\nVisually inspect storage areas weekly\nMaintain a binder of SDS pertaining to the specific batteries near the storage cabinets\n\nCharging\nLi batteries are grouped into two general categories: primary and secondary batteries. \n\nPrimary batteries consist of single-use cells containing metallic lithium anodes, are non-rechargeable and are commonly known as Li metal batteries\n\nNEVER charge a primary battery\nStore one time use (primary batteries) separately from secondary batteries; properly label the outer packaging to prevent this mistake\n\nSecondary batteries contain an intercalated Li compound for the anode and cathode. These batteries are rechargeable and are commonly referred to as Li-ion batteries\n\nUse the following guidelines when charging secondary batteries.\n\nWhen applicable, use Lithium Polymer (LiPo) bags to charge batteries\nUse only lithium-specific chargers to safely charge cells or battery packs\nCharge secondary batteries to approximately 50% - 70% of capacity before long-term storage. Most chargers will have a designated “storage-mode” dependent on the voltage, type of battery, and how many cells it is\nDisconnect batteries immediately if during operation or charging they:\n\nEmit an unusual smell\nEmit smoke\nOverheat or become abnormally hot\nThe battery begins to swell\nBehave abnormally\n\nDo not leave batteries and chargers unattended during charging. Charging should be in a manned space or remotely monitored\nRemove batteries from chargers promptly after charging is complete. Do not use the charger as a storage device/location\nDo not parallel charge batteries of varying age and charge status\nCheck voltage before parallel charging. All batteries should be within 0.5 volts of each other\nIf a battery cannot maintain a charge for its normal duration, even when properly charged, remove the battery from service and dispose of properly\n\nShipping:\nFederal regulations about shipping Li batteries are updated every year as new hazards are identified. Due to these yearly updates, this document will not provide specific shipping instructions. SWFSC personnel needing to ship Li batteries must take the appropriate International Aviation Transportation Association (IATA), International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG), or Department of Transportation (DOT) training, attend and update their training certification every 2 - 3 years, and provide a copy of the certificate to Marty Nelson, Safety Engineer, SECO. Trained personnel will also adhere to the Federal regulations that govern the specific mode of transportation to be used.\nDisposal\n\nIn California, Li-metal/ion batteries are considered hazardous waste and need to be disposed of properly. All Li batteries types (AAA, AA, C, D, button cell, 9-volt, etc), whether primary or secondary, must be recycled or taken to a household hazardous waste disposal facility, a universal waste handler (e.g., storage facility or broker), or an authorized recycling facility\nOptions for recycling\ni. The Big Green Box ($3.84/lb) https://biggreenbox.com/products/lithium-metal-batteries1\nii. Update Green ($2.00/lb) https://updategreen.com/\niii. Secure E-Waste Solutions https://www.sesrecycling.com/\n\nEmergency Response\n\nPreventative Measures\nPlease follow the steps outlined below to ensure that any batteries showing signs of misuse are handled and disposed of properly. Proper PPE will be worn when taking preventative measures including a lab coat, rubber gloves, and safety glasses.\ni. If batteries are showing evidence of thermal runaway failure, be very cautious; the gases may be flammable and toxic and failure modes can be hazardous\nii. Disconnect the battery (if possible)\niii. Remove the battery from the equipment/device (if possible)\niv.  Place the battery in a metal or other container away from combustibles\nFires\nIn the event that a Li metal or ion battery were to catch fire, a room could fill quickly with dense white smoke and the fire will be difficult to extinguish. The fumes and smoke from the fire can cause severe irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. All precautions must be taken to limit exposure to these fumes. The following actions should be taken:\ni. Evacuate personnel from all areas affected by the smoke and fumes and sound the fire alarm\nii. Assess the scene for unsafe conditions for yourself and others\niii. Assist victim, determine extent of injury, and administer first aid if appropriate and you are trained\niv. Ventilate the affected areas and continue ventilation until the odor is no longer detected\nv. Use a CO2 (Class BC) or dry chemical (Class ABC) fire extinguisher\nvi. Don’t use a Class D fire extinguisher \nvii. If possible, direct someone to call 9-911 for emergency response on one of the facility phones\n\nReporting\n\nAlert\ni. Facilities Manager (EXT 2880, cell 858-886-6553)\nii. Safety Officer (EXT 5650, cell 858-864-4136\niii. Front Desk Receptionist (EXT 7000)\nSend someone with a key card to meet the emergency responders at the loading dock and guide them through the facility doors - go up the elevator or stairs (many routes require a key card for access).\nUse the NOAASafe portal for the reporting of NOAA incidents, injuries, work related illnesses, or near misses. https://nsdesk.servicenowservices.com/noaasafe\nAlso, please refer to the NOAA Safety and Environmental Compliance Office (SECO) for any other safety-related issues. https://sites.google.com/a/noaa.gov/ocao/seco\n\n\n\nAttachment A",

During these meetings all members are expected to contribute by sharing progress reports, discussing challenges, and celebrating successes.\nWe use WebEx Teams for informal discussions between lab members and project teams. Similarly, we use Slack and Trello for some projects with external collaborators.\nAll lab members are expected to check & respond to email and Teams/Slack regularly\n\n\n\nCollaboration\n\nLab members and collaborators, including students, interns, volunteers, and other mentees, can expect respect, patience, and learning opportunities from each other.\nCollaborators are expected to be in regular communication with each other.\nAt the onset of a project, collaborators should discuss their expectations for the project and of each other, and establish a feedback system to evaluate progress along the way.\nCollaborators are encouraged to ask questions and seek understanding from each other.\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nLab members are expected to follow all safety protocols. If they are not sure of the protocol, then they should request this information.\nLab members should never feel obligated to perform a task that they do not feel is safe.\nLab members are encouraged to speak up if they feel they need training to perform a specific task safely.\nIf lab members have a safety concern, they should bring it up with the PI or the other lab members.\nIf a lab member feels their safety concerns are not being taken seriously, they can consult the SWFSC Safety Officer Ravi Shiwmangal (ravi.shiwmangal@noaa.gov).\n\n\n\nHandling or resolving incivility, harassment, or assault\n\nMaintaining a positive lab culture requires efforts from our entire research group. We expect all lab members:\n\nTo familiarize themselves with the definitions of incivility, microaggressions, harassment, and assault, and refrain from these behaviors.\nTo use safe, responsive, and effective ways to respond to cases of incivility, harassment, and/or assault that they observe or learn of from a lab member.\nTo offer support to those who have been harmed.\nTo make it possible for those who have been harmed to return to normalcy and/or work as soon as they wish. Alternatively, depending on the wishes of the person who has been harmed, to create opportunities for rest or leave from work or school.\n\nLab members should consider resolving conflicts with each other through empathetic but direct conversation.\nIf someone is not comfortable discussing an issue with the lab member who caused them harm, they can bring it up with the PI to mediate a conversation. If they do not feel comfortable interacting with the person who has harmed them, nor the PI, they may contact the program supervisor (Jeff Moore, jeff.e.moore@noaa.gov), the deputy director (Robin LeRoux, robin.leroux@noaa.gov) or the division director (Dave Weller, dave.weller@noaa.gov). Contractors should contact their contracting agency and interns should contact the intern leadership.\nLastly, they may also may consider these resources:\n\nNOAA Sexual Assault & Sexual Harassment\nPhone: 866-288-6558\nWebsite & Online Chat: https://noaasashhelpline.org/offsite link\nMobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)\nText: 202-335-0265 NOAA Equal Employment Opportunity complaint and counseling options\n\nActs of incivility, harassment, or assault within our lab group will lead to swift sanctions for the person who has caused harm, up to and including expulsion from the laboratory group depending on the wishes of the person who was harmed, and the severity of the act.\n\n\n\nOther important resources:\n\nSWFSC Team for Inclusion Diversity and Equity TIDE)\nSWFSC Emergency Plan\nOnline Guide to the Science of Effective Mentorship in STEMM\nNOAA Office of Inclusion and Civil Rights\nNOAA Fisheries Diversity & Inclusion\nNOAA Employee Resource & Affinity Groups\nNOAA Employee Assistance Program\n\nAvailable for NOAA employees & contractors: 3 free phone counseling sessions to identify & resolve specific issues of concern",
